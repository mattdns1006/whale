\abstract{Accurate monitoring of individuals in a threatened species is of upmost importance to conservationists and researchers. Human observation is expensive and autonomous ariel photography is becoming an increasingly useful technique regarding animal biometrics \cite{koh2012dawn,martin2012estimating}. Fewer than 500 North Atlantic right whales are left in the world's oceans. As with many animal biometric inspection processes, tracking and monitoring individuals is an extremely time consuming process. Advances in the implementation and performance of deep learning algorithms have drastically improved performance in object detection and recognition tasks \cite{lecun2015deep}.  We employ a wide range of interesting techniques to build a "face-identification" algorithm for ariel photos of 447 unique. We follow a conventional modern face recognition pipeline consisting of the stages: detect, align, represent and classify \cite{taigman2014deepface}. We use deep learning algorithms to both detect and classify. A fully convolutional network \cite{long2015fully} is employed to semantically segment a given image to detect the location of the whale's head and body, we then use PCA on the resulting image to normalize for the whale's direction. A significant amount of hand labelled masks are needed to generate enough supervised training data to make this work effectively \cite{hong2015decoupled}. We tackle this issue by employing semi-supervised learning techniques and histogram matching between images to improve our localization algorithm and find a significant improvement in our results.}

\section{Introduction}
We entered the 2015 Right Whale Recognition online competition issued by Kaggle. Data consists of aeriel images, the vast majority containing a single Right whale. There are $M$ = 447 unique whales, each of which has at least one photo in the training set which contains 4543 labelled images. The test set contains $N$ = 6925 unlabelled images. Evaluation is based on the multi-class logarithmic loss
\begin{eqnarray}
\text{logloss} = - \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{i=1}^{M} y_{ij} \text{log}(p_{ij}),
\end{eqnarray}
where log is the natural logarithm, $y_{ij}$ is 1 if observation $i$ belongs to whale $j$ and 0 otherwise, and $p_{ij}$ is the predicted probability that observation $i$ belongs to whale $j$. 

The data was collected and labelled over a 10 year period by NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospehric Administration) scientists via numerous helicopter trips over the northern Atlantic. 

We follow the conventional pipeline of alignment and classification and break our task of classifying a given photo, denoted $X_i$ into two main stages, both of which employ using convolutional neural networks;
\begin{itemize}
\item Alignment - We first reduce the dimensionality of $X_i$ and normalize for the distance to and orientation of the whale, generating a headshot of the whale, denoted $X_i^h$.
\item Classification - $X_i^h$ is passed through a classifier which outputs a probability mass function over the 447 whales.
\end{itemize}

\section{Alignment}

It is helpful to remove variation in inputs before giving them to a deep learning algorithm and, especially with faces, the success of a learned network is highly dependant on an alignment step \cite{lecun2012efficient,taigman2014deepface}. We randomly choose 550 images from our training set $M^{Train}$ and another random 150 images to generate a test set $M^{Test}$. Using a graphics editor, for each $X_i \in {M^{Train}, M^{Test}}$ we create a semantic mask denoted $M_i$. An example of a pair is shown in figure \ref{fig:whaleLabel}.
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Example of $\{X_i,M_i\}$ pair;\
a) $X_i$, b) $M_i$.
}\label{fig:whaleLabel}
\end{figure}
We distinguish between head, body and sea using red, yellow and black respectivley. Having two colors for distinguishing parts of the whale enables us to infer the direcition in which the whale is pointing. We rescale each $X_i$ to dimension $w \times h \times c = 600 \times 900 \times 3$ and each $M_i$ to $w^{'}\times h^{'}\times c^{'} = 19 \times 29 \times 3$. We use a fully connected convolutional neural network (FCNN) to learn a function $f: \real^{w\times h \times c} \to \real^{w^{'}\times h^{'}\times c^{'}}$. We are not interested in a huge amount of detail being produced in our predicted $M_i$, enough to infer head and body location, hence our choice for a smaller output space.

We describe our neural network architecture as follows;
\begin{align}\label{eq:whaleconv1}
	 F_1 = \{\text{down\textsubscript{0}} - , ... , - \text{down\textsubscript{4}} - 3\text{C}_{2D}3/1 - \text{sigmoid}\}, 
\end{align}
	where 
\begin{align*}
			 \text{conv\textsubscript{n}} &= \{(48 + 32\text{n})\text{C}_{2D}3/1 - \text{BN} - \text{ReLU}\} \\	
     		 \text{down\textsubscript{n}}  &= \{\text{conv\textsubscript{n}}- \text{MP}3/2\}. \\	
\end{align*}
The following notation for denoting a network architecture is similar to \cite{graham2014fractional} where $\{a-b-c\}$ denotes a network which is passed through the three layers $a$ to $b$ and finally $c$. $fC_{iD}k/s$ denotes an $i$ dimensional convolutional layer with kernel size $k$ in each dimension, a stride of $s$ and number of filters $f$. Similarly MP$k/s$ is a two dimensional max-pooling layer with kernel size $k$ and stride $s$. Other layer notations; BN $=$ batch normalization, ReLU and Sigmoid are layers of rectified linear activation units and sigmoid activation units respectively.

%%Assume that $\alpha>0, \gamma>1, \beta>\frac{\gamma+1}{\gamma-1}$.
%%Then there exists a small $\tau_1>0$, such that for $\tau\in
%%[0,\tau_1)$, if $c$ crosses $c(\tau)$ from the direction of

%%(2.1), and the period of $(\check{u}^p(s),\check{w}^p(s))$ is

%%\check{T}(c)=c\cdot \left[\frac{2\pi}{\omega(\tau)}+O(c-c(\tau))\right].

%%\begin{condition}\label{C2.2}
%%From (0.8) and (2.10), it holds
%%$\frac{d\omega}{d\tau}<0,\frac{dc}{d\tau}<0$ for $\tau\in
%%[0,\tau_1)$. This fact yields that the system (2.1) with delay
%%$\tau>0$ has the periodic traveling waves for smaller wave speed $c$
%%than that the system (2.1) with $\tau=0$ does. That is, the
%%delay perturbation stimulates an early occurrence of the traveling waves.
